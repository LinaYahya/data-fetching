# Data fetching code along workshop
We’ve explained that Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering.Now, we’ll talk in depths about data fetching strategies for each case.

 We'll code the three unique Next.js functions you can use to fetch data for pre-rendering:

- getStaticProps (Static Generation): Fetch data at build time.
- getStaticPaths (Static Generation): Specify dynamic routes to pre-render based on data.
- getServerSideProps (Server-side Rendering): Fetch data on each request.


### Now code time
We’d like to create a note App, we'll view our notes, add new note, and view specific note.

1. Clone this repo
2. cd todo && npm i
3. check files
4. pgcli then build createDB.sql then build.sql
5. npm run dev
6. start from index.js

##### Have fun time :wink:
